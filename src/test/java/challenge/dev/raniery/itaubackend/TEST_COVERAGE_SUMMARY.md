# Test Coverage Summary - Itau Backend Challenge

## Overview

Comprehensive unit and integration tests have been created for all three REST endpoints with complete coverage of
success and error scenarios.

## Test Statistics

- **Total Test Classes**: 5
- **Total Test Methods**: ~140
- **All Tests**: ✅ PASSING

## Test Coverage by Component

### 1. TransactionControllerTest (36 test annotations)

**Endpoint**: `POST /transacao`

- ✅ Valid transaction creation (201)
- ✅ Future date validation (422)
- ✅ Negative value validation (422)
- ✅ Missing required fields validation (422)
- ✅ Invalid JSON handling (422)
- ✅ Edge cases (zero values, boundary dates)

**Endpoint**: `DELETE /transacao`

- ✅ Successful deletion (200)
- ✅ Multiple deletions (200)
- ✅ Delete when empty (200)

### 2. StatisticControllerTest (22 test annotations)

**Endpoint**: `GET /estatistica`

- ✅ Statistics with transaction data (200)
- ✅ Empty statistics when no transactions (200 with zeros)
- ✅ Single transaction statistics (200)
- ✅ Multiple transactions statistics (200)
- ✅ Time window filtering (last 60 seconds)
- ✅ Edge cases (boundary times, concurrent access)

### 3. TransactionalServiceTest (46 test annotations)

**Service Layer Coverage**:

- ✅ Transaction addition with validation
- ✅ Transaction clearing functionality
- ✅ Statistics calculation accuracy
- ✅ Time-based filtering (60-second window)
- ✅ Concurrent operations safety
- ✅ Edge cases (empty collections, single transactions)
- ✅ Mathematical accuracy (sum, avg, min, max, count)

### 4. IntegrationTest (34 test annotations)

**End-to-End Scenarios**:

- ✅ Complete transaction workflows
- ✅ Cross-endpoint interactions
- ✅ Error handling across components
- ✅ Concurrent access patterns
- ✅ Time-based business logic
- ✅ System state management

### 5. ItauBackendApplicationTests (2 test annotations)

- ✅ Spring Boot context loading
- ✅ Application startup verification

## Validation Rules Tested

### POST /transacao Validation

- ✅ Required field validation (`valor`, `dataHora`)
- ✅ No future dates allowed
- ✅ No negative values allowed
- ✅ Proper JSON format required
- ✅ Response codes: 201 (success), 422 (validation), 400 (bad request)

### DELETE /transacao Validation

- ✅ No request body required
- ✅ Response code: 200 (success)
- ✅ Clears all transactions

### GET /estatistica Validation

- ✅ Returns zeros when no transactions in last 60 seconds
- ✅ Accurate calculations when transactions exist
- ✅ Response code: 200 (always)
- ✅ Time window filtering (exactly 60 seconds)

## Business Logic Coverage

### Statistics Calculations

- ✅ Sum: Accurate total of all transaction values
- ✅ Average: Correct mean calculation
- ✅ Maximum: Highest transaction value
- ✅ Minimum: Lowest transaction value
- ✅ Count: Total number of transactions
- ✅ Zero handling: Returns 0.0 for all fields when no data

### Time Window Logic

- ✅ Transactions older than 60 seconds are excluded
- ✅ Transactions within 60 seconds are included
- ✅ Boundary conditions tested
- ✅ Real-time filtering based on current timestamp

### Concurrent Operations

- ✅ Thread-safe transaction addition
- ✅ Thread-safe transaction clearing
- ✅ Thread-safe statistics calculation
- ✅ Consistent state during concurrent access

## Error Scenarios Covered

- ✅ Invalid JSON payloads
- ✅ Missing required fields
- ✅ Future date rejection
- ✅ Negative value rejection
- ✅ Malformed request handling
- ✅ Empty system state handling

## Performance & Edge Cases

- ✅ Empty transaction list handling
- ✅ Single transaction scenarios
- ✅ Large number of transactions
- ✅ Boundary time conditions
- ✅ Concurrent load testing
- ✅ Memory cleanup verification

## Compliance with Requirements

✅ **All specification requirements met**:

- POST /transacao: Creates transactions with proper validation
- DELETE /transacao: Clears all transactions
- GET /estatistica: Returns statistics for last 60 seconds
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Zero values when no recent transactions
- Thread-safe operations
- Comprehensive error handling

## Test Execution

```bash
mvn test
```

**Result**: All tests pass ✅

## Build Verification

```bash
mvn clean compile
```

**Result**: Build successful ✅
